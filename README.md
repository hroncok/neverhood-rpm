The Neverhood RPM for Fedora (unofficial, nonfree)
==================================================

How to build
------------

 1. get `Neverhood.iso`, place it in this folder
 2. run `fedpkg --release f26 mockbuild` or similar
 3. install resulting RPM (from `results_neverhood/`)

Using
-----

There is an app launcher called *The Neverhood*. Or you can run `neverhood`
from the console. It forwards all arbitrary options to `scummvm`, see them with
`neverhood --help`. Such option my be `--no-fullscreen`.

There is a config file in `/etc/xdg/neverhood.ini` that is copied to
`~/.config/neverhood.ini` if that one is not present. Feel free to tweak the
options in your config, such as setting `skiphallofrecordsscenes` to `true`
or `fullscreen` to `false`.

Enjoy.
